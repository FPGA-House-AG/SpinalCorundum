/**
* In this algorithm, the hidden window size must be a power of two,
* for example, 1024 bits. The redundant bits must also be a power of
* two, for example 32 bits. Thus, the supported anti-replay window
* size is the hidden window size minus the redundant bits. It is 992
* in this example. The size of the integer depends on microprocessor
* architecture. In this example, we assume that the software runs on
* a 32-bit microprocessor. So the size of the integer is 32. In order
* to convert the bitmap into an array of integers, the total number of
* integers is the hidden window size divided by the size of the
* integer.
*
* struct ipsec_sa contains the window and window related parameters,
* such as the window size and the last acknowledged sequence number.
*
* all the value of macro can be changed, but must follow the rule
* defined in the algorithm.
